Template-2
Notes:
If you want to open the project in your browser creat a folder and name it what you want and then extraire all the files in the folder
and creat another folder inside the folder you have and name it "images2"
I'm sorry if there is lot of thinks to do 
You can also see the scrennshots taking from the project:
